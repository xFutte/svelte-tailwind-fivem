# Svelte + TailwindCSS + FiveM

This template for developing FiveM resources should get you easily started with developing delightful FiveM resources. It can both work as a template for open-source projects and paid projects. The `fxmanifest.lua` file contains the needed properties for both use cases.

## Configuration file

In `svelte-source/src/config.json` you can add configuration for the UI. This file will be copied to the `html` folder containing the compiled Svelte code.

## Types

TypeScript types for FiveM natives have been made easily available to use. They will be installed when all `node_modules` are installed and can be in-commented in the `tsconfig.json` file.
